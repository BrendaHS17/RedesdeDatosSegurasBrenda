<h2>6G</h2>
<p>As its name suggests, is the sixth generation of mobile connectivity. Just as 
4G succeeded 3G and 5G succeeded 4G , 6G will come to replace 5G with higher 
speed and even lower latency.</p>
<p>In addition to greater bandwidth and speeds much higher than 5G , 6G will also 
offer many other advantages. One of them will be the reduction of latency, which 
will be 0.1 milliseconds. This becomes a near real-time data stream. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there is also talk of an even greater reduction in energy 
consumption. We remember that 5G is very energy efficient, reducing 4G 
consumption by 90%. Although there are no exact data yet, 6G will once again 
reduce electricity consumption considerably. 
Another point to note is that 6G will increase the number of simultaneous device 
connections. All this will enable the use of new and still unexplored 
technologies</p>

<h2>Wifi 6</h2>
<p>
Wi-Fi 6 is a substantial improvement over previous generations, though the 
differences may not seem immediately obvious to the average user. These changes 
may not drastically alter the way we use wireless routers or networks, but 
consist of many enhancements that, when combined, result in a substantial 
upgrade.
The first big change is that Wi-Fi 6 allows for potentially faster connection 
speeds.
</p>
<p>With Wi-Fi 6, organizations and service providers can support new and emerging 
applications on the same wireless LAN (WLAN) infrastructure while simultaneously 
providing a higher level of service to legacy applications. This landscape lays 
the foundation for new business models and increased adoption of Wi-Fi.
<p/>
<p>
Faster Wi-Fi means faster upload and download speeds (or data throughput) due to 
the increased bandwidth made possible by Wi-Fi 6. This becomes more and more 
important as file sizes increase, coupled with increased data demands for 
high-quality video streaming and communication-heavy online gaming.</p>
